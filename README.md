This is a discord bot made with Python. The libraries used are listed in packages/requirements.txt. It is made with the cogs system or something i forgot lol.
Just a warning that that a lot of commands a) do not work, or b) don't really do anything (lol). When using the bot, the prefixes you can use are:
